#Notes for Section 3

## Set-up stuff
- install node and yarn using whatever
- using `-g` on `npm install` will install it globally (i.e. not just to this project)
 

- `npm install -g live-server`
  - for the live reload functionality, seeing changes to your webpage soon as you make them in the code
  - then `live-server public` to run it (must be run from wherever *public* directory is)


- `npm install -g babel-cli`
  - for the compilation of ES6/7 to ES5 
  - syntactic sugariser basically
  - so you can use JSX in a nice way


- `yarn init` or `npm init` to create the *package.json* and allow you to install the local dependencies your project needs (e.g. the babel-cli you installed above)
- `yarn add babel-preset-react@6.24.1 babel-preset-env@1.5.2` to install all these dependencies locally
  - installs those dependencies locally instead of globally
  - so they're just for this project
  - you can see your local dependencies package.json
  - they are all stored in *node_modules*
  - can also look in yarn.lock file to see specific details of all your local dependencies e.g. where they were downloaded from
    - good for when you're debugging an issue e.g. seeing if you have wrong library version etc


- `yarn install` installs all the local dependencies defined in your package.json


- `babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch`
  - why we have an app.js in the public/scripts folder AND in src?
    - the one in *src* will contain our JSX and all our actual coding etc
    - the one in *public/scripts* will be an auto-generated file created by Babel when it reads the *src/app.js*
      - this is what the index.html actually uses
    - The command above creates the scripts/app.js from the output of babel reading src/app.js
  - `--watch` flag sets babel to monitor any changes made to src/app.js and update the scripts/app.js as soon as changes are made
    - so you don't have to keep running this command every time you make a change (as long that --watch command is running)
